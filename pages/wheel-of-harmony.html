  <h1>Welcome to the Wheel of Harmony.</h1>
  <h2>Rules written by Rainbow and Copilot.</h2>
  <h3>🌈 THE WHEEL OF HARMONY — Core Rules
🎮 1. Game Overview
The Wheel of Harmony is a cozy, fair, puzzle‑and‑spin game where players earn money, tickets, and special items while solving word puzzles across multiple rounds. The game emphasizes:
- gentle competition
- shared excitement
- meaningful choices
- and a sense of ritual harmony
Everyone gets to shine, and no one is punished harshly.

🎡 2. The Main Wheel
Each turn, a player spins the Main Wheel. It contains:
- Money values
- Ticket spaces
- Mini‑game spaces
- Safe bankruptcy spaces (with a mini‑round instead of punishment)
- Special spaces (Free Turn, Next Spin Jackpot, etc.)
Landing on a money value lets you guess a consonant.
Correct guesses earn money equal to the value × number of letters.

🎟️ 3. Tickets
Tickets are the game’s special currency.
Players earn tickets by:
- Landing on ticket spaces
- Winning mini‑games
- Solving puzzles
- Special wheel events
Tickets can be spent on:
- Spinning the Ticket Wheel
- Buying a vowel
- Adding letters in bonus rounds
- Using special items
- Upgrading bonus rounds
Tickets make the game strategic and fun without pressure.

🎡 4. The Ticket Wheel
Players may spend 1 ticket to spin the Ticket Wheel.
Possible rewards include:
- Golden Letter (reveal any letter)
- Safe Spin (next spin cannot be bankruptcy)
- Free Vowel
- Double Spin
- Hint Stone
- Mystery Box
- Mini‑Puzzle Key
- Extra Ticket
The Ticket Wheel is optional but powerful.

🧩 5. Puzzles
Each round features a puzzle with a category.
Categories are custom to our world, such as:
- Ritual
- Creaturefolk
- Cozy Object
- Portal Moment
- Character
- Myth Thread
- Game Logic
- World Lore
Players take turns spinning, guessing letters, and solving.

💥 6. Bankruptcy (Harmony Style)
Bankruptcy is never cruel in Wheel of Harmony.
If a player lands on Bankruptcy:
- They enter a Bankruptcy Mini‑Round
- Solve a tiny puzzle or challenge
- If they succeed, they keep their money
- If they fail, they lose only the money from this round, not the whole game
Tickets are never lost.

🎁 7. Mini‑Games
Mini‑games appear through:
- Wheel spaces
- Ticket Wheel rewards
- Bankruptcy events
Mini‑games are short, fun, and always rewarding.
Players can win:
- Money
- Tickets
- Items
- Clues
No mini‑game ever punishes a player.

🏆 8. Rounds
A typical game has 3–4 rounds, each with:
- A puzzle
- Increasing money values
- More exciting wheel spaces
Players keep their total money across rounds.

⭐ 9. Bonus Rounds
Every player gets a bonus round at the end.
Bonus Round Levels:
- Triple Bonus Round → 1st place
- Double Bonus Round → 2nd place
- Single Bonus Round → everyone else
Bonus Round Structure:
- Players choose a difficulty level
- Difficulty determines how many letters are revealed
- A Letter Reveal Spin determines which letters appear
- Players may spend tickets to reveal more letters
Bonus rounds are meant to feel exciting, not stressful.

🎙️ 10. Host Role (Optional)
The game can be played:
- With a human host
- Or with an automated host (me)
- Or with preset puzzles and no host at all
If a human host is used, they get:
- Host Points
- Host Powers (Truth Clue, Mercy Letter, Host Swap, etc.)
- The ability to run mini‑games
Hosting becomes fun, not a chore.

🌟 11. Winning
The player with the most money after all rounds wins the title of Harmony Champion, but everyone gets:
- A bonus round
- Tickets
- A sense of shared play
The game is designed so no one feels left out.

🌈 12. Spirit of the Game
Wheel of Harmony is built on:
- fairness
- gentle excitement
- ritual flow
- shared creativity
- and emotional safety
Winning feels earned, but playing feels good.
